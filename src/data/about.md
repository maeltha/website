# Info

- Zebras are highly social animals and live in groups called harems or herds. A harem typically consists of one male (stallion), several females (mares), and their offspring
- a giraffe's heart is incredibly powerful, capable of pumping blood up to its brain, which can be over 6 feet (1.8 meters) above its heart. The heart can weigh up to 25 pounds (11 kilograms).
- Giraffes are generally quiet animals, but they do communicate using infrasound, which is below the range of human hearing. They also make sounds like grunts, snorts, and hisses.
- Okapis are something special
