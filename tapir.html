    <h1>Tapir Holiday Plans</h1>
    <p>The Schabrakentapir, or Malayan tapir, has some unique holiday plans. Here's what a typical tapir holiday looks like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning:</strong> A refreshing swim in the river, followed by a hearty breakfast of leaves and twigs.</li>
        <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> A luxurious mud bath to keep cool and fend off pesky insects.</li>
        <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Stargazing while munching on some delicious fruits, with the occasional splash in the water for fun.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tapirs know how to relax and enjoy the simple pleasures of life!</p>
