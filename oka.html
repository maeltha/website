    <h1>Okapi Holiday Plans</h1>
    <p>The okapi, also known as the forest giraffe, loves to spend its holidays in the dense rainforests. Here's a sneak peek into an okapi's holiday itinerary:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning:</strong> A leisurely stroll through the misty rainforest, nibbling on fresh leaves and fruits.</li>
        <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> A relaxing nap by a hidden stream, away from the hustle and bustle of the jungle.</li>
        <li><strong>Evening:</strong> A moonlit dance party with fellow okapis, complete with jungle beats and fireflies as disco lights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Okapis sure know how to have a good time in the wild!</p>
